[{"content":"Welcome to Tropical Blog! Hey everyone, welcome to my blog! My name is Zekeria Sammantar, and I\u0026rsquo;m an IT adventurer. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working in the IT world for 11 years now, and let me tell you, it\u0026rsquo;s been a wild ride. From dealing with angry users to battling stubborn code, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it all. But hey, it\u0026rsquo;s all part of the fun, right?\nSo why \u0026ldquo;Tropical Blog,\u0026rdquo; you might ask? Well, as much as I love tech, I also love a good beach. And what\u0026rsquo;s more tropical than a blog about IT adventures? Nothing, that\u0026rsquo;s what.\nIn this blog, I\u0026rsquo;m going to take you on a journey through the crazy world of IT. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about everything from coding to networking to cybersecurity. I\u0026rsquo;ll share my experiences, my tips and tricks, and my favorite memes (because who doesn\u0026rsquo;t love a good IT meme?).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what you can expect from me: Lots of laughs. I mean, let\u0026rsquo;s face it, IT can be a bit dry sometimes. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we can\u0026rsquo;t have fun with it. Real talk. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest with you about my successes and my failures, because let\u0026rsquo;s be real, we all make mistakes sometimes. Practical advice. I\u0026rsquo;ll share the things that have worked for me (and the things that haven\u0026rsquo;t) so that you can learn from my experiences. So if you\u0026rsquo;re ready for a wild ride through the IT world, then strap in and let\u0026rsquo;s go! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share this adventure with you.\n","permalink":"https://zakicisco.github.io/posts/welcome-post/","summary":"Welcome to Tropical Blog! Hey everyone, welcome to my blog!
